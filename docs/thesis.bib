  abstract = {A direct procedure for obtaining the Fourier coefficients of a chain-encoded contour is presented. Advantages of the procedure are that it does not require integration or the use of fast Fourier transform techniques, and that bounds on the accuracy of the image contour reconstruction are easy to specify. Elliptic properties of the Fourier coefficients are shown and used for a convenient and intuitively pleasing procedure of normalizing a Fourier contour representation. Extension of the contour representation to arbitrary objects at arbitrary aspect angle is discussed. The procedures have direct application to a variety of pattern recognition problems that involve analysis of well-defined image contours.}

  abstract = {Chemoinformatics is an established discipline focusing on extracting, processing and extrapolating meaningful data from chemical structures. With the rapid explosion of chemical ‘big’ data from HTS and combinatorial synthesis, machine learning has become an indispensable tool for drug designers to mine chemical information from large compound databases to design drugs with important biological properties. To process the chemical data, we first reviewed multiple processing layers in the chemoinformatics pipeline followed by the introduction of commonly used machine learning models in drug discovery and QSAR analysis. Here, we present basic principles and recent case studies to demonstrate the utility of machine learning techniques in chemoinformatics analyses; and we discuss limitations and future directions to guide further development in this evolving field.}

  abstract = {Abstract In cheminformatics, compounds are represented as points in multidimensional space of chemical descriptors. When all pairs of points found within certain distance threshold in the original high dimensional chemistry space are connected by distance-labeled edges, the resulting data structure can be defined as Dataset Graph (DG). We show that, similarly to the conventional description of organic molecules, many graph indices can be computed for DGs as well. We demonstrate that chemical datasets can be effectively characterized and compared by computing simple graph indices such as the average vertex degree or Randic connectivity index. This approach is used to characterize and quantify the similarity between different datasets or subsets of the same dataset (e.g., training, test, and external validation sets used in QSAR modeling). The freely available ADDAGRA program has been implemented to build and visualize DGs. The approach proposed and discussed in this report could be further explored and utilized for different cheminformatics applications such as dataset diversification by acquiring external compounds, dataset processing prior to QSAR modeling, or (dis)similarity modeling of multiple datasets studied in chemical genomics applications.},
