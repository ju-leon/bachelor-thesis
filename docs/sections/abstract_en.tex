\Abstract

The goal of this thesis is to finds rotationally invariant features of catalysts using their 3D representation. 
Using a catalysts unique shape, features are extracted so that spacial orientation of the molecule is of no significance. 
The generated features are then used to train a neural network that predicts properties of the molecule.
